# CGI_Website_In_C
I created this project in one of my classes Spring 2016. I decided to make a dynamic website using the C programming language. With permission I used a friend's Hibernate/JAX-RS API, and edited it to be compatible with the database for this project. The website is a basic login detail that uses an HTTP GET request to confirm that the user is logged in, and when they are, it would display the most recent temperature values that were in the database. My friend wrote the temperature sensor program using an Arduino, that pushed the data to the database. The entire project was run on my personal server that I built January 2016. Also the CSS this uses is what I use for my website.
